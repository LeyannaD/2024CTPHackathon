My CUNY Calendar

This is a website design for CUNY students to check out the first hand news on what's happening around their campus, save their time and attention taht was waste on gathering these fragmented info.

Inspiration

As CUNY students, we noticed that valuable resources and information about opportunities are scattered all around the campus. Being students ourselves, we know the importance of being organized and staying up to date with everything. Sometimes it is hard to do that because it is time consuming to search for the right information that we are looking for. Even when there are a huge amount of opportunities available out there, we often miss these opportunities because of the lack of efficient ways for schools to spread the information.
What it does

We create a platform that has all the information organized: from campus events, to club activities, to supporting resources, and a calendar that updates the events that students add. This way we will have all the necessary informations at one place that is easy to access by all the students.
How we built it

We first went on Figma to created a blueprint for the website where we can follow along. Then, we created a Github repository that can be shared to members in the team so we can all work together. Lastly, the tools that we used to create this website are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Firebase and JavaScript.
Challenges we ran into

There were some challenges we ran into. The first issue was time management. Since some of us were at work, it was difficult for us to get the project done exactly the way we wanted because we have limited time to meet up and discuss about it. Second issue was the height of the Nav Bar of My Calendar page not matching up with other pages. Third issue was firebase, because we don't have much experience with the database. We had spent a lot of time figuring out how to implement firebase to our project.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of that the styling of the webpage looks similar to what we envisioned on Figma. The calendar page aligns with the real dates because of JavaScript implementation. We setup the Firebase and used some of its features where we can pull the database for our carousel and the event poster elements in the Campus Event Page. Also, when clicking on the 'Learn More' button, there will be a pop-up window that shows a more detailed description of the event.
What we learned

We are all new to Bootstrap, but throughout the project, we are now comfortable using Bootstrap to styling the web page. Additionally, we are more similar with git version control as we collaborate throughout the process of building our project. We also get some senses of how Firebase works with database.
What's next for CUNYConnect

Our team decided to still work on the project and make it aesthetically pleasing while ensuring we implement all the features we talked about, such as login page, calendar features that connects to the events, allows students to post blogs and differentiate accounts between regular students and the official accounts for posting.
