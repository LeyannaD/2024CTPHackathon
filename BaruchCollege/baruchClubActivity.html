                <div class="EventTitle"> Japan Club </div>
                <div class="EventDescription"> Japan Club is focused on providing significant opportunities for Baruch College students, Japanese and Non-Japanese students alike, with two focuses: The organization aims to aid Japanese students and those interested in working in Japanese companies or in fields dealing with Japan markets in communication and building relationships so as to assist them in the job-hunting process. Japan Club does this by organizing Career Forum Workshops, for those with business proficiency level in Japanese that are preparing to attend job interviews, networking receptions, or events such as Boston Career Forum. We organize Networking Events with various Japanese and American Companies, and collaborating with other organizations on campus holding events to assist in professional development. The organization is also aimed at promoting Japanese cultural-awareness. By utilizing our network with clubs on campus, other Japan Clubs in other Universities, outside Japanese organizations such as Japan Society and Resobox to our close ties with the Consulate General of Japan in New York, the organization strives to not only assist those who would like to gain work experience with companies related to Japan but also to provide opportunities to experience the beauty and depth of Japan and its people. Japan Club does this by organizing events such as: Japanese Conversation Classes (where students can practice Japanese at a beginner, intermediate, or advanced level), Food Day events (dedicated to educating and celebrating the delicious beauty of Japanese cuisine), Travel Seminars (for those interested to traveling to Japan either to Study Abroad, gain fluency in Japanese, or enjoy its culture), and even a Japanese-American performing arts showcase (“West Meets East Matsuri”) as well as many other events dedicated to celebrating its culture and authenticity. </div>

                <div class="EventDescription"> The West Indian Culture Club (WICC) is a workshop which was formed in 1974 to promote West Indian culture, not only at Baruch College, but on the North American continent. Our workshop consists of multi-talented students not only from the various West Indian islands but from other parts of the globe. However, our common goal remains — to promote the West Indian culture and to bridge the gap that exists between other cultures and our own. We present to the Baruch community different aspects of the West Indian culture through various media: films, speakers, fashion shows, dance of the various islands, arts and crafts exhibitions. All are welcome to participate. </div>
